Firmware for Melzi 1.1.4 board
To use:
Flash any arduino to be ArduinoISP, using the File > Examples > 11. ArduinoISP

Install Sanguino board definition using https://github.com/Lauszus/Sanguino 
> To use this add-on simply add the following url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauszus/Sanguino/master/package_lauszus_sanguino_index.json to the Arduino boards manager. Please see the following page for more information: https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164.

Copy the whole "grbl" folder into Document > Arduino > Libraries
(Re)Open Arduino IDE,a library named grbl should now be available, open the grblUpload.ino file (File > examples > grblUpload)

Wire up the Arduino to the ISP port:
If you look at the Melzi board from the top down with the CREALITY3D text upside down, the ISP port is on the left
(display cable)
(1)(2)
(3)(4)
(5)(6)
(usb mini connector)
Wire up the SPI connector:
1 Grnd > Grnd
2 Reset > Pin 10 
3 MOSI > Pin 11 
4 SCK > Pin 13 
5 5V > 5v/Vcc (Or leave disconnected, power through USB mini port/power supply)
6 MISO > Pin 12

In Tools>Port Select the COM port of the ArduinoISP
In Tools>Processor Select Atmega1284 or Atmega1284p
In Tools>Programmer Select "Arduino as ISP"  

Upload the file using Arduino as ISP, CTRL+Shift+U is a hotkey to do this
